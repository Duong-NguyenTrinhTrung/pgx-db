                    In the rapidly evolving field of pharmacogenomics, the demand for efficient and user-friendly tools to access and analyze genetic data in the context of medication-use has never been greater. Researchers and healthcare professionals seek solutions that empower them to explore the intricate relationship between an individual's genetic makeup and their response to various drugs. To meet this need, we have developed an interactive web-based resource, <strong>PGxDB</strong>, offering a dynamic platform for comprehensive pharmacogenomics research and hypothesis testing covering diverse data types. <br><br><strong>PGxDB</strong> is providing researchers with the means to harness the vast <span style="color: #00a6fb"><i>genetic information</i></span> from large population studies and their associations to drug treatments. It uniquely combines the relationship between <span style="color: #00a6fb"><i>ATC-level indexed medications</i></span>, their <span style="color: #00a6fb"><i>molecular target profiles</i></span> in terms of metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and drug targets, with their genetic variability and predicted variant effects. The tool allows molecular scientists and clinicians alike to compare and customize analysis on high-level indication areas, find and interlink diverse <span style="color: #00a6fb"><i>variant effect predictions</i></span>, associate these to annotated drug response variability associations and interrogate disease or medication associations in a single scalable resource. The advanced data visualization tools within <strong>PGxDB</strong> including visual representations of genetic data, drug interactions, and associations can help users quickly grasp complex relationships. <br><br>With <strong>PGxDB</strong>, we aim to catalyze breakthroughs in pharmacogenomics research, empowering drug discovery, support clinical decision making, interdisciplinary research and pave the way for more personalized and effective drug therapies accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise.
