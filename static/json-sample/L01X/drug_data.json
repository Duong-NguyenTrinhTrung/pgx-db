Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121]. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase C\u00ce\u00b3 (PLC\u00ce\u00b3)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression [A121]. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121]. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [A40276] by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 [A121].

Individual \u00ce\u00b2-subunits allow specific catalytic action of the 20S core.[A18509, A204083] In mammalian cells, bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of the proteasome\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chymotryptic-like activity, which is attributed to the \u00ce\u00b25-subunit of the 20S core particle.[A18509] Bortezomib binds to the active site of the threonine hydroxyl group in the \u00ce\u00b25-subunit.[A204083] A probing study showed bortezomib also binding to and inhibiting the \u00ce\u00b21-subunit, which mediates the caspase-like activity of the proteasome, and \u00ce\u00b21i-subunit, which is an altered subunit that is expressed to form immunoproteasomes in response to cell stress or inflammation.[A18509] By inhibiting the proteasome-mediated degradation of key proteins that promote cell apoptosis,[A18508] bortezomib induces a cell cycle arrest during the G2-M phase.[L14180] It is believed that multiple mechanisms, other than proteasome inhibition, may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.[A204083] The anticancer activity of bortezomib was largely associated with suppression of the NF-\u00ce\u00baB signalling pathway, resulting in the downregulation of anti-apoptotic target genes and expression of anti-apoptic proteins. This may be explained by bortezomib preventing uncontrolled degradation of I\u00ce\u00baB, which is an inhibitory protein of NF-\u00ce\u00baB. NOXA, which is a pro-apoptotic factor, induced by bortezomib selectively in cancer cells; thus, it is suggested to be another key mechanism of bortezomib.[A204083]\", \"absorption\": \"Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> doses, the mean C<sub>max</sub> of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively.

In patients with multiple myeloma, the C<sub>max</sub> of bortezomib followig subcutaneous administration was lower than that of intravenously-administered dose; however, the total systemic exposure of the drug was equivalent for both routes of administration.[L14177] There is a wide interpatient variability in drug plasma concentrations.[L14180]\", \"toxicity\": \"The Lowest published toxic dose (TD<sub>Lo</sub>) in mouse was 5 mg/kg/14D following intraperitoneal administration of an intermittent dose and 1.6 mg/kg/12D following subcutaneous administration of a continuous dose.[L14198]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe therapeutic dose of bortezomib is individualized in each patient to prevent overdose. Fatal outcomes occurred in humans following the administration of more than twice the recommended therapeutic dose of bortezomib. The symptoms from overdose included the acute onset of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia. As there is no known antidote for bortezomib overdosage, monitoring of vital signs and appropriate supportive care should be initiated when drug overdosage is suspected. In monkeys and dogs, increased heart rate, decreased contractility, hypotension, and death were observed with the intravenous dose as low as two times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis.

[Rofecoxib], another member of the COX-2 inhibitor drug class, also known as Vioxx, was withdrawn from the market due to prothrombotic cardiovascular risks.[L7622] Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials were evaluated, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs was evident.[L3293] It was determined that the benefits of celecoxib treatment, however, outweighed the risks.[L7622] Postmarketing cardiovascular outcomes trial (PRECISION) revealed that the lowest possible dose of celecoxib was similar in cardiovascular safety to moderate strength doses of both naproxen and ibuprofen. Patients who had previous cardiovascular events including acute MI, coronary revascularization, or coronary stent insertion were not evaluated in the trial. It is not advisable to administer NSAIDS to these groups of patients.[L3293]\\r\\n\", \"moa\": \"Unlike most NSAIDs, which inhibit both types of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), celecoxib is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 is expressed heavily in inflamed tissues where it is induced by inflammatory mediators.[L7646] The inhibition of this enzyme reduces the synthesis of metabolites that include prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane (TXA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and prostaglandin F2 (PGF2). Resultant inhibition of these mediators leads to the alleviation of pain and inflammation.[A34124,L7646] \\r\\n\\r\\nBy inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause mucosal damage, ulceration and ulcer complication throughout the gastrointestinal tract.[L7646] Celecoxib poses less of an ulceration risk than other NSAIDS, owing to its decreased effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis when compared to placebo.[A34152] \\r\\n\\r\\nCelecoxib exerts anticancer effects by binding to the cadherin-11 (CDH11)protein,  which is thought to be involved in the progression of tumors, and inhibiting the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) signaling mechanism.[T647,A11861] In addition, celecoxib has been found to inhibit carbonic anhydrase enzymes 2 and 3, further enhancing its anticancer effects.[A28426,A20066]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs mentioned in the pharmacodynamics section of this drug entry, celecoxib may cause an increased risk of thrombotic events. The risk of thrombosis resulting from COX-2 inhibition is caused by the vasoconstricting actions of thromboxane A2, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation, which is uncontrolled when the actions of prostacyclin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, are suppressed through the inhibition of COX-2.[L7622]\", \"absorption\": \"Celecoxib is absorbed rapidly in the gastrointestinal tract.[A34124] When a single oral dose of 200 mg was given to healthy research subjects, the peak plasma levels of celecoxib occurred within 3 hours.[A34124,L7646] The Cmax is 705 ng/mL.[L3296] When multiple doses are given, steady-state concentrations are reached on or before day 5. When taken with a high-fat meal, peak plasma levels are delayed for about 1 to 2 hours with an increase in total absorption (AUC) of 10% to 20%.[L7646] The AUC of celecoxib has been shown to be significantly lower in patients with chronic renal impairment.[A4983,L7646] A meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies has suggested an approximately 40% higher AUC (area under the curve) of celecoxib in black patients compared to Caucasians for unknown reasons.[L3296]\", \"toxicity\": \"The oral TDLo in humans 5.71 mg/kg.[L7610]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not advisable to administer celecoxib in patients with renal impairment or advanced hepatic impairment, as this may lead to increased serum concentrations, causing toxicity.[L7646] Symptoms of overdose may include breathing difficulties, coma, drowsiness, gastrointestinal bleeding, high blood pressure, kidney failure, nausea, sluggishness, stomach pain, and vomiting.[L3293] Because serious gastrointestinal tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without preceding symptoms, patients should be monitored for signs/symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding. Symptomatic and supportive measures should be taken in a celecoxib overdose. The induction of emesis or administration of active charcoal should take place if the patient is seen within 4 hours of celecoxib ingestion.

Although the exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that the effectiveness of tretinoin in acne is due primarily to its ability to modify abnormal follicular keratinization. Comedones form in follicles with an excess of keratinized epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes detachment of cornified cells and the enhanced shedding of corneocytes from the follicle. By increasing the mitotic activity of follicular epithelia, tretinoin also increases the turnover rate of thin, loosely-adherent corneocytes. Through these actions, the comedo contents are extruded and the formation of the microcomedo, the precursor lesion of acne vulgaris, is reduced. Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo. When Tretinoin is given systemically to APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR).

Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known.

DNA topoisomerases are enzymes in the cell nucleus that regulate DNA topology (3-dimensional conformation) and facilitate nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, DNA topoisomerase I creates reversible single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA, allowing intact single DNA strands to pass through the break and relieve the topologic constraints inherent in supercoiled DNA. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strand binds covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells can be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predominantly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug.\", \"moa\": \"Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death).\\r\\n\\r\\nTopotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (\u00e2\u0088\u00921) and downstream (+1) base pairs.

Regulation of repair pathways is critical in promoting necessary cell death. BRCA genes are tumor suppressor genes mediate several cellular process including DNA replication, transcription regulation, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, chromatin structuring and homologous recombination (HR). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), along with PPAR inhibition, is a vulnerability that enhances the cell death pathway when the single mutations alone would permit viability. Ovarian cancer commonly possesses defects in DNA repair pathways such as HRD due to BRCA mutations or otherwise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three main types of ovarian cancer: epithelial (90%), germ cell (5%) and sex cord stromal cell (5%). Epithelial ovarian, being the most common, fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States. Advanced ovarian cancer particularly poses challenges due to reduced therapeutic response rates from standard platinum-based chemotherapy and overall survival rates. Rucaparib has shown to induce cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes [FDA Label].

When PARP is inhibited, single-strand breaks become double-strand breaks, which are typically repaired via homologous recombination [A18745].

It is proposed that PARP inhibition specifically targets tumor cells with preexisting HRD, such as those cells possessing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes [A31354]. Rucaparib induces synthetic lethality by disrupting ingle- and double-strand repair pathways leading to tumor cell death. It is also suggested that PARP inhibition can lead to trapping of PARP-1 enzyme on damaged DNA, effectively preventing continuation of the DNA repair process; defective BRCA1 recruitment to damaged DNA; and activation of alternative DNA repair such as error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative end joining pathways leading to mutations or chromosomal changes and ultimately cell death [A31354].\", \"absorption\": \"Rucaparib demonstrates a linear pharmacokinetic properties over a dose range from 240 to 840 mg twice daily with time-independence and dose-proportionality.
