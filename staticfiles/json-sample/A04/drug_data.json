Palonosetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist that is pharmacologically related to other 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, but differs structurally. Palonosetron has a high affinity for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors, but has little to no affinity for other receptors. The serontonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is suggested that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.\", \"moa\": \"Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Alternative mechanisms appear to be primarily responsible for delayed nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic chemotherapy, since similar temporal relationships between between serotonin and emesis beyond the first day after a dose have not been established, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists generally have not appeared to be effective alone in preventing or ameliorating delayed effects.

While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions.

Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation.

Scopolamine is contraindicated in angle-closure glaucoma and should be used with caution in patients with open-angle glaucoma due to scopolamine's ability to increase intraocular pressure. Also, scopolamine exhibits several neuropsychiatric effects: exacerbated psychosis, seizures, seizure-like, and other psychiatric reactions, and cognitive impairment; scopolamine may impair the ability of patients to operate machinery or motor vehicles, play underwater sports, or perform any other potentially hazardous activity.

Recent evidence suggests that M1 (and possibly M2) mAChR antagonism at interneurons acts through inhibition of downstream neurotransmitter release and subsequent pyramidal neuron activation to mediate neurological responses associated with stress and depression.[A228773] Similar antagonism of M4 and M5 receptors is associated with potential therapeutic benefits in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.[A228743] The significance of these observations to scopolamine's current therapeutic indications of preventing nausea and vomiting is unclear but is linked to its anticholinergic effect and ability to alter signalling through the CNS associated with vomiting.[A228758, L31578]\", \"absorption\": \"The pharmacokinetics of scopolamine differ substantially between different dosage routes.

The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].\", \"moa\": \"Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT3 [F3178, F3181, F3184].\\r\\n\\r\\nCytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].\", \"absorption\": \"Ondansetron is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some limited first-pass metabolism [F3178]. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following administration of a single 8-mg tablet, was recorded as being approximately 56% to 60% [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food [F3178].\\r\\n\\r\\nOndansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose [F3178]. The AUC from a 16-mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from an 8-mg tablet dose [F3178]. This may reflect some reduction of first-pass metabolism at higher oral doses [F3178].\", \"toxicity\": \"At present, there is little information concerning overdosage with ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Nevertheless, there have been certain cases of somewhat idiosyncratic adverse effects associated with particular dosages of ondansetron used [F3178, F3181, F3184].\\r\\n\\r\\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSudden blindness\u00e2\u0080\u009d (amaurosis) of 2 to 3 minutes duration plus severe constipation occurred in one patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Hypotension (and faintness) occurred in another patient that took 48 mg of oral ondansetron [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Following infusion of 32 mg over only a 4-minute period, a vasovagal episode with transient second-degree heart block was observed [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic instability, somnolence, and a brief generalized tonic-clonic seizure (which resolved after a dose of benzodiazepine) were observed in a 12-month-old infant who ingested seven or eight 8-mg ondansetron tablets (approximately forty times the recommended 0.1-0.15 mg/kg dose for a pediatric patient) [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In all instances, however, the events resolved completely [F3178, F3181, F3184].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety of ondansetron for use in human pregnancy has not been established [F3181, F3184].
